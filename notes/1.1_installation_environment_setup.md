- [code commit here](https://github.com/sample-projects-only/emailgui/tree/main)


- Note: if you are trying to run ng command in vscode terminal and getting following error  : 
```text
File C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\npm\ng.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system...
```
- run folowing command in powershell admin mode first
```text
set-executionpolicy remotesigned

Alternatively:
    set Command Prompt as the default shell Instead of PowerShell (PowerShell is default) in the terminal window where you select a terminal instance
```
