## What is Dependency Injection
 - Dependency Injection (DI) is a programming technique that makes a class independent of its dependencies.So class requests dependencies from external sources rather than creating them.
 - In a nutshell, Angular dependency injection aims to decouple the implementation of services from components. This eases testing, overriding, and altering of services without affecting the components dependent on these services.
 - **A 'dependency' is an object that can be used, for example as a service.**

## Types of DI

1. Constructor Injection
2. Property DI
3. Method DI 


- In software development, there are several proposed patterns for handling dependency injection. A**ngular enforces the constructor injection pattern, which uses the constructor to pass in the dependencies of a class as parameters of the constructor.**

- Angular has its own built-in dependency injection (DI) framework that provides dependencies to classes upon instantiation

- This is an important feature for building scalable web applications in Angular

- create new angular service: 
```text
D:\lggram\angular\myapp\emailgui\src\app>ng generate service products/product
CREATE src/app/products/product.service.spec.ts (362 bytes)
CREATE src/app/products/product.service.ts (136 bytes)
```

product.model.ts
```typescript
//app/products/product.model.ts
export interface Product {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}
```
- The above snippet uses the TypeScript interface to create a model to validate data returned from the products service

product.service.ts
```typescript
//app/products/product.service.ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Product } from './product.model';
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class ProductService {
  constructor() { }
  getProducts(): Product[] {
    return [
      { id: 1, name: 'Nike' },
      { id: 2, name: 'Balenciaga' },
      { id: 3, name: 'Gucci' },
      { id: 4, name: 'Addidas' },
    ];
  }
}
```
- The providedIn property creates a provider for the service. In this case, providedIn: 'root' specifies that Angular should provide the service in the root injector (i.e., make it available in the entire application).
- Now, ProductService can be injected anywhere in our application:
