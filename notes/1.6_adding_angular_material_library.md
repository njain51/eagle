## Testing

- lets say we want to create button using material library
- add following import statement to src\app\app.module.ts and also add MatButtonModule to imports
```text
https://material.angular.io/components/button/overview 
```

- next we will add button to src\app\components\home\home.component.html by adding following code: 
```text
<button mat-raised-button color="primary">Send Email</button>
```

- after restart of ng server, output will be as follows:
